## 🚀 Welcome to DriveIntel

**DriveIntel** is a real-time driver safety & behavior analytics platform built exclusively for ride-hailing drivers. By leveraging on-device sensor data (accelerometer, gyroscope, and microphone) via Machine Learning (ML) models, it detects stressful driving situations, analyzes dangerous behavior patterns, and provides highly personalized safety coaching—all wrapped in a stunning, premium dark-themed glassmorphic user interface.

## ✨ Core Features

DriveIntel provides a complete suite of powerful tools designed for both individual drivers and ride-hailing platform analysts:

*   **📊 Dynamic Dashboard** — Get a comprehensive daily trip overview, your overall safety score, a stress event timeline, and high-level behavior insights at a glance.
*   **🗺️ Interactive Trip Mapping** — **Risk along route:** Leaflet maps with dynamically severity-colored route segments based on live event timestamps. Includes playback cursors and rich popups explaining the severity, model confidence, and safety logic.
*   **📈 Advanced Trends** — Understand your driving behavior over time with weekly/monthly patterns, fatigue tracking, and stress event analytics.
*   **🎯 Goal Tracking** — Improve your daily safety by setting, committing to, and tracking behavioral modifications (e.g., reduce harsh braking, defensive driving).
*   **🔮 Predict & Preview** — Enter raw sensor telemetry for instant stress prediction. Also features a preview Map with high-risk geographical zones.
*   **📁 Batch Processing** — Built for analysts. Upload a CSV of multi-driver telemetry and run large-scale inference simultaneously for macro-level safety analysis.
*   **🤖 AI Co-Pilot Assistant** — An integrated, context-aware AI Safety Assistant (powered by Google Gemini) ready to provide interactive, personalized coaching and guidance on demand.
*   **🔍 Explainable AI (XAI)** — Understand *why* an event was flagged. DriveIntel provides per-event feature contributions (e.g., high lateral acceleration) and model confidence percentages.

## 🎨 Premium UI/UX

DriveIntel utilizes a custom **High-Contrast Dark Glassmorphism** design language.
The entire application was built iteratively to reflect an ultra-modern aesthetic standard using Tailwind CSS:

*   **Vibrant Gradients over Deep Backgrounds** (`slate-950` / `slate-900`)
*   **Translucent Frosted Glass** layered panels (`backdrop-blur-xl`, `bg-white/5` borders)
*   **Sleek Micro-animations**, customized chart tooltips, and dynamic states
*   Zero legacy light-mode elements—providing drivers with maximum visibility, luxury, and eye comfort even during late-night shifts.

## 🛠️ Setup & Local Development

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Node.js 18+

### 1. Install & Run Directly

Start the backend:
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r ../requirements.txt
python main.py
```
*(Runs on `http://localhost:8000`)*

Start the frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
*(Runs on `http://localhost:5173`)*

Open **http://localhost:5173** to use the application.

### 2. Run via Docker Compose

```bash
# Navigate to repository root
docker compose up --build
```
Then visit `http://localhost:5173`! All API calls are locally proxied by NGINX inside the container.

## 🔮 Roadmap (Next Steps)

*   [ ] **Predictive High-Risk Routing** — Seamless integration of the *Predict* UI with production historical accident dataset grids for live hazard routing.
*   [ ] **In-Trip Voice Coaching** — Expand the AI Assistant into an active voice companion that speaks safely contextualized warnings.
*   [ ] **Telematics Database Integration** — Migrate the in-memory data store to a production-ready PostgreSQL instance with PostGIS for geo-queries.
